# Scope

This document specifies a distributed file system. It is applicable to networked, peer-to-peer, Cloud, offline, local-first, cross-application, and blockchain use cases where optionally encrypted files, directories or other data needs to be shared between principals in multi-leader-write arrangements with write access verification by third parties.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
